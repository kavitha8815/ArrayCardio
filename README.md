Today I have done a project on Array cardio to practice array methods like find(), some(), every(), map() and filter(). This helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills in JavaScript ES6!.

# Key Learnings

-- Objects finding inside an array using find() and findIndex().

-- Condition checking using some() and every() in arrays.

-- console.table() for structured output in the console.

-- slice() helps to remove elements efficiently.

# Technologies used

-- HTML

-- CSS

-- Javascript

#Output

-- A table displaying an array of people.

-- A table displaying an array of comments.

-- Checking the logs if all users are adults based on their birth year.

-- Finding and removing a comment based on its ID.

# Setup Instructions
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

# Clone the repository

##Navigate to the project directory
cd ArrayCardio
##open ArrayCardio.html

#Further Improvements
-- Add an interactive UI where users can input and manipulate data dynamically
